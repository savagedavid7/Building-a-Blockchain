# Blockchain Case Study: HIVE Blockchain (TSXV: HIVE)

## What Is It
HIVE Blockchain is one of the world's largest and most diversified publicly-listed cryptocurrency miners. HIVE aims to build a bridge from the blockchain space to traditional capital markets. HIVE owns state-of-the-art GPU-based digital currency mining facilities in several developed, politically stable jurisdictions. These mining facilities produce digital currencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin continuously. HIVE is one of the most mature companies in the Blockchain space, particularly in the mining sub-sector, with a relatively strong balance sheet and decent operating margins.

## Why This Matters

HIVE Blockchain, as an early mover in the Blockchain space, provides shareholders with unique pure-play exposure to the strong operating margins of digital currency mining. Additionally, HIVE now holds a portfolio of mined crypto-coins that make up a growing part of HIVE's healthy balance sheet.

Today, HIVE has 100% control of management and mining operations. 

## Why This May be Interesting

HIVE has several built in advantages in this space that make HIVE an attractive investment. Firstly, HIVE has first-mover advantage as the first publicly listed blockchain infrastructure company. HIVE is unique in the blockchain space as a pure-play mining investment for capital markets. Secondly, particularly in Canada, HIVE is a low-cost operator, with operations situated in jurisdictions with access to cheap/renewable energy sources. This low-cost advantage means HIVE is unlikely to face any new emerging competitive threat. Additionally, low working capital requirements allows HIVE to strategically time its sale of mined coins. 

HIVE unlike many of its competitors in the mining space has 100% of its operations situated in democratic and politically stable jurisdictions. Additionally, all of HIVE's mining operations are powered entirely by renewable energy sources - likely to be a growing issue for its competitors, as regulators become more and more familiar with the companies in this space.
